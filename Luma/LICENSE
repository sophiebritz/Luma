IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:

This is an academic coursework project from Imperial College London (DESE71003 
- Sensing and Internet of Things) and is NOT intended for commercial use or 
deployment without:

1. Comprehensive real-world crash testing under controlled conditions
2. Formal safety certification (CE marking, EN 1078 compliance)
3. IP-rated waterproofing for electronic components
4. Regulatory approval for safety-critical wearable electronics
5. Extended field testing with diverse user populations
6. Privacy impact assessment and GDPR compliance audit
7. Cybersecurity penetration testing of BLE communication

The crash detection system was trained on simulated falls (drop testing) and 
may not accurately detect all real-world crash scenarios. Always wear a 
properly certified helmet when cycling.
